  I began my journey at Newbarn Ltd. as a dedicated team administrator.
  Currently, I'm pursuing my AAT certification; besides this, I have done Level
  4 in Forensics Accounting, which has deepened my understanding of financial
  processes and management. My personal growth and development have thrived as a
  result of my embrace of daily challenges and the opportunity to take on new
  financial tasks with enthusiasm. My passion lies in making a positive impact
  on people's lives, both within our organization and beyond. As a service

  our collective success. This aspect of my role brings excitement to each day
  and adds immeasurably to my learning and development journey. I am looking
  forward to making a more productive and positive impact on the Newbarn family!
