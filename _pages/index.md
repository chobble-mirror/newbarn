Newbarn is an inclusive, Tenant needs-led, high-quality accommodation and support service that promotes social inclusion and enables vulnerable adults to achieve their full potential.

We provide alternative support solutions for people with mental health needs and learning disabilities. Through bespoke support and accommodation packages, we aim to meet the wants and needs of the Tenant and to work with their support team. This may be supported living, shared accommodation or single tenancies throughout Rochdale.

We provide a range of social care activities that include emotional and psychological support and promote wellbeing, prevent the need for more costly acute care services and that are oriented towards enablement, recovery, diversity and social inclusion

We uphold the privacy and right of every individual to be treated as such â€“ with care, respect and dignity; to live as independently as possible in their own home and to receive the highest quality care and support to enable them to do so.

We include and support families and carers by listening, reflecting and respecting their values and beliefs.

Newbarn offers support, advice and accommodation, which includes help with budgeting, cooking, shopping, cleaning and other everyday tasks, as well as with keeping doctors' appointments, managing self-medication and ensuring good health and safety is provided.
