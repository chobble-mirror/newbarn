<p>I have worked in this role with Newbarn for 18+ years, since September 2006.
  The role of Service Lead is a diverse one â€“ it includes supporting our tenants
  with their daily support needs, managing a fantastic team of dedicated and
  skilled staff and attending many local forums to both promote the service and
  to keep up to date with all the changes that are happening locally and
  nationally.</p>
