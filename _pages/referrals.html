<p>Referrals can be made using the Rochdale Mental Health Allocation Panel's referral and 'Consent to Disclosure' forms. Both forms can be downloaded, opened in Microsoft Word, completed electronically and forwarded as an attachment to karen.kilburn@rochdale.gov.uk, or newbarnltd@gmail.com. Alternatively this can be printed off and posted to:</p>
<p><strong>Housing allocation panel</strong><br />

<p>If forwarding as an attachment, the printed names of referrer and client on the &quot;Consent To Disclosure&quot; form will be accepted as the client's consenting to the disclosure of relevant information and the referrer's giving of advice with regard to housing and support.</p>
