Currently, I'm pursuing my AAT certification; besides this, I have done Level 4 in Forensics Accounting, which has deepened my understanding of financial processes and management. My personal growth and development have thrived as a result of my embrace of daily challenges and the opportunity to take on new financial tasks with enthusiasm. My passion lies in making a positive impact on people's lives, both within our organization and beyond. As a service finance administrator, I'm committed to continuous growth and contributing to our collective success. This aspect of my role brings excitement to each day and adds immeasurably to my learning and development journey. I am looking forward to making a more productive and positive impact on the Newbarn family!
