The role of Service Lead is a diverse one â€“ it includes supporting our tenants with their daily support needs, managing a fantastic team of dedicated and skilled staff and attending many local forums to both promote the service and to keep up to date with all the changes that are happening locally and nationally.</p>

<p>Hello..! I have a varied background with many different life experiences. I am an ex-professional boxer and I currently also coach boxing in Littleborough in my spare time. I love working with our tenants as it leaves you with an enormous sense of well being.
I have started training again and look forward to an increase in my fitness and have recently taken part in Bereavement Counselling training which has been both eye-opening and I have learned a lot about both myself and the course.</p>
