The support services that Newbarn Ltd provide are commissioned by the Rochdale Adult Care Commissioning Team. We provide Supported Living services to people living in our 24 hour supported tenancies and Homecare and Outreach support to people living both in tenancies that we offer and also in their own homes.

Referrals into our service come via [Rochdale Adult Care] or local Community Mental Health Teams.

With both routes of referral, there is a Care Act assessed and bespoke, person-centred support plan.

For more information, or if you feel you would benefit from our services, please contact Rochdale Adult Care Commissioning Team on [01706 922841] or via email to [adultcarecommissioningteam@rochdale.gov.uk].
